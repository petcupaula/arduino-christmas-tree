# arduino-christmas-tree

Control your Christmas tree lights by clapping your hands and by voice using a Google Home.
* Use a sound sensor connected to Arduino to detect clapping, and then turn on/off lights (standard Christmas tree lights and Hue lights) on the tree using a relay
* Use an app for syncing the Hue lights with music played on Spotify
* Use Google Home to voice control the music (and thus the Hue lights sync)
